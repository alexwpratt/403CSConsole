 * Olympic Soccer Tournament
 * 
 * Draw a class diagram that represents a Soccer Tournament. You will need a Team parent class, a child soccer class, and a game class. Write a program that prompts the user to enter in the number of teams competing in an olympic soccer tournament. Then for the number of teams entered, prompt the user to enter the name of the team and the number of points the team has scored. Finally, display the results of the tournament. Make sure your console output matches the sample screenshot in the requirements below exactly.
 * 
 * Requirements:

 Console output matches sample output completely (see screenshot below)
 First letter of each teams's name is capitalized
 Program uses a List object to store the list of teams
 Teams are sorted by the team's points in descending order
 Result table has column headers and separators for Position, Name, and Points
 Result table displays each team's position, name, and points
 Properly implements Team and SoccerTeam classes but you do NOT need to implement the Game class
 Use exception handling to make sure that the number of teams they enter is a valid integer (try/catch within a while loop).
 Adds comments to make code easier to understand
 Upload the project here and also upload the zipped project to the Learning Suite assignment (include the class diagram in your upload in the main root directory for your project so TAs can easily find it) and then schedule a time with the TAs for them to grade this assignment
